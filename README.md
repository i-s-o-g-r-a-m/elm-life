# Life in Elm

See it in the browser [here](https://i-s-o-g-r-a-m.github.io/elm-life/).

The shapes refer to the work of Karel Martens -- in particular, these
configurations from the [cover of OASE 65](http://www.oasejournal.nl/en/Issues/65)
were used as a reference:

In this version, dead cells are crosses, just-born cells are crosses with circles,
and reborn cells are crosses with circles and four rotated squares. SVG
transparency is used to mimic over-printing in the originals. And maybe
the action of layering can correspond to something poetic in the cycle
of life?
